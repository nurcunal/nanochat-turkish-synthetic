This folder is generated by `synthetic/prepare_accepted_sets.py`.

It contains ONLY judge-accepted synthetic TRAIN data in nanochat CustomJSON JSONL format:
- each line is a JSON array of alternating {"role":"user"} / {"role":"assistant"} messages
- no "system" role

These files are intended to be used for training via `nanochat-master-turkish/tasks/customjson.py`
(e.g., mid-training and/or SFT mixtures).
